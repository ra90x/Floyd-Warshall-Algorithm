Following are the requirements for this project:

Rewrite Floydâ€™s algorithm to use recursion.

Write to PEP standards. Put under source control and write unit tests for each function. Write performance tests and check your version against the one located at the above website.

You will need to submit your code and a report of between 1000 and 1500 words. Your code submission should include your directory tree as well as code documentation. This should include as a minimum a readme.md and requirements.txt as well as other documentation that you may see fit to include.

In the report discuss how the application was built, and how you created the tests, as well as the coverage of your tests. Also, try to have a hypothesis to explain the differences between the performance of the iterative version on the PDF and your own recursive version.

Be sure that all contents are easily accessible. If you use an online service (i.e. GitLab), make sure settings allow anyone with the direct link to access the repo, even after receiving your grade. 

Please, use this template to write your report. Attached
